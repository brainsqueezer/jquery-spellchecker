					This page shows how this plugin can be used to check the spelling of a chunk of text. The plugin supports two type of 
					spell checking engines: php's pspell extension for aspell, or google's spell checking services. If you are able to use
					pspell, you will have greater control over your dictionary, although it wouldn't be too difficult to use a custom
					dictionary in conjunction with google's service.

						"But I must hopss Hopss explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denounncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. Noo one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequencse's that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying caonsequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
					</p>
					<p>
						"On the other hand, we anounce with righteous indignations's and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that arre Arre bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who faile in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleaasure is to be welcomed and edvery pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
